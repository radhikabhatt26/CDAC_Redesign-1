# Re-Design of the website for the Commerce Data Advisory Council (CDAC)

The CDAC provides expert guidance and insight to the Department of Commerce's data leadership, covering a wide range of pressing issues in data and technology.

The Department of Commerce collects, processes, and disseminates approximately 36% of the federal open data. That data fuels planning, research and operations that support society and the economy. Commerce is continuously working to improve in its delivery of services. 

To help guide the Department's efforts, Secretary of Commerce Penny Pritzker has assembled the Commerce Data Advisory Council (CDAC).
